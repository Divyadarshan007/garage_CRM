# Project Standards
I have a modular rules system stored in a 'project-rules' folder. 
Whenever I start a new project or task, you must ALWAYS:
1. Check the root for a 'project-rules' folder.
2. Read 'main.md' first to understand the structure.
3. Strictly follow 'working-style.md' before writing ANY code (Plan -> Approval -> Code).
4. Apply the Backend (Express), Frontend (Next.js), and MongoDB rules defined in that folder.
